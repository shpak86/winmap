# WiNMap

Wireless Networks Mapper

## Descriprion

WiNMap project created as a hackathon solution.

We had to create an application that would allow us to collect information about the device as well as information 
about Wi-Fi networks and send it to the server. In addition, a port scanner, connection speed meter and the ability to 
view reports were added. Authorization on the server was implemented. only registered users can submit reports. 
The interface is implemented in the form of interactive tiles that allow you to display background processes.
 
 What's realized:
- Android device information collection
- Connection information
- Available networks information collection and periodical refreshing
- TCP ports scanning
- Server authorization
- Sending collected data to server as a report
- Display reports from server
- Measure upload and download speed



This is a part of the system. Server part named **boomerang** is available 
[here](https://github.com/shpak86/boomerang).
